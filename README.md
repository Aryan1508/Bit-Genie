# About
**TLDR; I got addicted to chess programming**

With  all the lockdowns in 2020, I decided that it would be a good time to start working on a new project. I have lots of love for programming; I have lots of love for chess, so a chess software seemed like a good start. I ended up creating a small & simple chess GUI which although wasn't easy, didn't satisfy me. I thought it would be interesting if I could write a program that could play *good* chess  and possibly beat me. And that's how I started writing Bit-Genie.  What I didn't know was chess programming is very addictive , and it would turn out to be more than a small project.  What inspired me the most was the huge community of open-source chess engines like [Ethereal](https://github.com/AndyGrant/Ethereal "Ethereal")

As of March 2020, Bit-Genie isn't a top-tier chess engine, but we're getting somewhere.

# Usage
Bit-Genie is **not** a complete chess software, but a chess engine which still needs a GUI if you don't prefer writing and reading [UCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Chess_Interface "UCI") commands through the terminal. There are plenty of free softwares available online, here are two common ones
- [Cute Chess](https://github.com/cutechess/cutechess "Cute Chess")
- [Arena Chess GUI](http://www.playwitharena.de/)


# Build 
Bit-Genie comes with a [makefile](https://github.com/Aryan1508/Bit-Genie/blob/master/Bit-Genie/makefile "makefile") that you can use to build your own binaries. 

```
git clone --single-branch --branch master https://github.com/Aryan1508/Bit-Genie
cd Bit-Genie/Bit-Genie
make 
./Bit-Genie
```
