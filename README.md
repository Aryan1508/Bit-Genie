# About
**TLDR; I got addicted to chess programming**

With  all the lockdowns in 2020, I decided that it would be a good time to start working on a new project. I have lots of love for programming; I have lots of love for chess, so a chess software seemed like a good start. I ended up creating a small & simple chess GUI which although wasn't easy, didn't satisfy me. I thought it would be interesting if I could write a program that could play *good* chess  and possibly beat me. And that's how I started writing Bit-Genie.  What I didn't know was chess programming is very addictive , and it would turn out to be more than a small project.  What inspired me the most was the huge community of open-source chess engines like [Ethereal](https://github.com/AndyGrant/Ethereal "Ethereal")
